# Hades Botnet

## Overview
Hades Botnet is a network of compromised computers that are controlled by a centralized server. It is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates various features and concepts of botnets.

## Features
- Command and Control (C&C) server: The server component of the botnet responsible for managing and controlling the connected client bots.
- Client Stubs: The compromised computers that act as bots and receive commands from the C&C server.
- Modular Architecture: The botnet supports the creation of various modules that can be loaded into the client bots, enabling different functionalities such as DDoS attacks, data exfiltration, and more.
- Communication Protocols: The botnet implements custom communication protocols between the server and client stubs for command exchange and data transfer.

## Technologies Used
- Language: Java
- Network Communication: Sockets
- Command and Control: Server-Client Architecture
- Module Development: Java Programming
